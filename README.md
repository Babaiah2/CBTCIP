1. BANKY

BankY is a simulation of a basic banking system that allows users to create accounts,
deposit and withdraw funds, and transfer funds between accounts. This project provides 
an opportunity to explore fundamental concepts of object-oriented programming, 
data persistence using files or databases, and basic transaction handling.


2. GUESS THE NUMBER

The fun and easy project "Guess the Number" is a short Java project that allows the user to guess the number generated by the computer & involves the following steps:
1. The system generates a random number from a given range, say 1 to 100. 
2. The user is prompted to enter their given number in a displayed dialogue box.
3. The computer then tells if the entered number matches the guesses number or it is      higher/lower than the generated number.
4. The game continues under the user guessing the number. You can also incorporate further details as:
Limiting the number of attempts.
Adding more rounds.
Displaying score.
Giving points based on the number of attempts.
